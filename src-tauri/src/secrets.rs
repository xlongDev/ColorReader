//! Credentials at rest.
//!
//! The AI key, the DeepL key and the WebDAV password live in the `settings` KV
//! table, which is a plain SQLite file: whatever can read the profile directory
//! can read them. This module seals the *fields* that hold a credential — the
//! same list a backup blanks, so "what is encrypted" and "what is redacted out
//! of a backup" cannot drift apart — and then the file on its own is not enough
//! to read them.
//!
//! The key is 32 bytes from the OS CSPRNG, held by the platform credential
//! store (Keychain Services / Credential Manager / Secret Service). There is
//! deliberately **no Argon2 step here**, unlike `.ctzx`: that one stretches a
//! human password, and stretching an already-uniform 256-bit key would spend
//! its 19 MiB of work on every save to buy nothing. The reader never sees a
//! prompt — the OS is what gates access, per application.
//!
//! Sealing is per field, and the row key plus the field name travel as GCM
//! additional data. A blob therefore only opens where it was written: swapping
//! `deeplKey` and `apiKey` inside the database file is an authentication
//! failure rather than a silently exchanged credential.
//!
//! A value written before this module existed carries no prefix and is handed
//! back untouched — see [`seal_existing`] for the one-shot pass that puts those
//! away.
