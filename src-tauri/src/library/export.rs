//! Notes export: highlights and notes as a file the reader keeps after the app
//! is gone.
//!
//! Two shapes, picked by the destination extension. Markdown reads like a page
//! — the quoted passage, then the note under it, grouped by chapter. CSV is one
//! row per highlight, for a spreadsheet. Both are plain UTF-8 text: no archive,
//! no schema, nothing that needs this app to open again. A book pack (see
//! `pack`) is the other half of the story and answers a different question —
//! that one is for restoring the *reading state*, this one is for reading it.
//!
//! Either scope writes the same per-highlight blocks: `export` takes one book,
//! `export_selection` takes whatever set of highlights a screen is showing,
//! across as many books as they come from. Only the book-level framing differs
//! between the two, which is why the importer on the other side reads a header
//! rather than a fixed layout.
//!
//! Chapters are headings by *number*, never by title looked up in `chapters`:
//! foliate books number their annotations by section, and a title fetched by
//! that index would be off by exactly the offset those two lists differ by.
//! The number is also what the reader's own annotation list shows, so the file
//! and the app agree on where a highlight lives.
//!
//! Every highlight also carries a `colorreader://` link back to itself. The
//! link names the book and the annotation and *nothing else* — no position, no
//! chapter, no offset. Positions are the one thing this app cannot state
//! portably: a foliate highlight is anchored by CFI, a paragraph one by
//! character offset, a PDF one by page, and the three do not convert into each
//! other. The row the id points at already knows which of the three it is, so
//! the link stays true across all of them, and a reader who opens it lands on
//! the passage in whichever renderer that book uses.
