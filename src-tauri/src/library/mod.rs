//! The library domain: sorting rules, cover URLs and book removal.
//!
//! Twenty-six modules used to sit flat in this directory, mixing five
//! unrelated domains in one bucket — a dictionary parser next to a WebDAV
//! client next to the shelf's own queries. They are grouped into
//! subdirectories now, and every one is re-exported here, so
//! `crate::library::<module>` still names the same thing it always did: the
//! grouping is about which file to open, not about a new public path.
//!
//! The subdirectories are private for two reasons. `retrieval/` and
//! `transfer/` are not the report's `search/` and `sync/` because
//! `pub mod search;` next to `pub use search::search;` is `E0255` — a module
//! and a re-export of a module cannot share a name. Keeping all seven private
//! solves that uniformly instead of for two of them.
