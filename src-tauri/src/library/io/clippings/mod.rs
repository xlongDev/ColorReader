//! Reading highlights back in — from Kindle, and from this app's own exports.
//!
//! Three shapes, told apart by [`detect`] from their content rather than their
//! name: Kindle's `My Clippings.txt`, and the Markdown and CSV files
//! [`crate::library::export`] writes. All three come out as the same
//! [`Clipping`]s and go through the same [`import`], so the report, the
//! de-duplication and the anchoring are one code path.
//!
//! What each source knows differs, and nothing is invented to paper over it. A
//! Kindle entry is a title, an author and a passage. An export adds the reader's
//! own note, the ink and the chapter the highlight sits in — which turns the
//! search from "every chapter" into "the one it names" — and the CSV adds the
//! paint style as well. The Markdown has no colour in it at all, because it is
//! written to be read as a page rather than parsed.
//!
//! An export also links back to the book it came from, and that link is the
//! strongest thing either source carries: it names the book by id, so a renamed
//! book still matches and a shelf holding the same title twice is not a coin
//! toss. `Catalog::lookup` — the title path, all a Kindle file can offer —
//! resolves a repeated title by taking the first, which is fine as a fallback
//! and not good enough when the file knows.
//!
//! The Kindle `My Clippings.txt` case, in detail: the file knows a highlight's
//! *text* and a `位置 #1234-1237` line number, and nothing else. The line number
//! counts positions inside the file Amazon shipped, which is not the file we
//! have: a re-imported AZW3, an EPUB from elsewhere, a re-flowed TXT all number
//! their positions differently. So the text is the only anchor that survives,
//! and that is what this module matches on — every clipping is located by
//! finding its text in the chapter bodies we already store for full-text search.
//!
//! Matching ignores whitespace and the invisible characters the two sides
//! disagree about (Kindle drops the line breaks an EPUB splits a paragraph at;
//! extracted book text keeps soft hyphens the clipping does not have).
//! Everything else has to be identical, which it is: both sides are the same
//! sentence.
//!
//! For EPUB/MOBI/AZW3 the located offsets are not enough on their own — those
//! books are painted by foliate, which anchors on a CFI. [`Annotation.cfi`]
//! stays `None` here and the reader resolves it the first time it loads the
//! section (see `FoliateBookView`); the offsets are what the annotation list
//! orders by until then.
//!
//! [`Annotation.cfi`]: crate::library::annotations::Annotation::cfi

//! The split is by which file to open. This one holds the model the three
//! shapes share and the one decision that has to be made before any of them
//! runs; `kindle`, `markdown` and `csv` each read one source; `anchor` finds the
//! book and the passage inside it; and `import` walks the path a preview walks
//! and writes nothing when it is one.
