//! `mini_bar.*` commands: the shell state behind the floating read-aloud bar.
//!
//! The bar is a second window, and it exists because a window that is not on
//! screen cannot draw. The in-app pill lives inside the main window, so putting
//! that window away — minimized to the Dock, or hidden by the red button —
//! takes the transport with it, and the only thing left to pause with is the
//! menu-bar icon. This is the other half: a small always-on-top capsule that
//! stays on the desktop while the reader is somewhere else.
//!
//! What this module does *not* decide is what the bar shows. The queue, the
//! position and the voice are frontend state, and the frontend is exactly what
//! the bar is drawn next to; so the frontend pushes what to draw over
//! `tts://mini-state` and the bar forwards its buttons as the same names the
//! tray already uses (`tts://control`). What is left for Rust are the two
//! things the frontend cannot see: whether the main window is on screen at all,
//! and the shape of the bar's own frame — a webview knows its content and not
//! the window around it, so the bar says which face it is drawing and the
//! geometry is worked out here.
