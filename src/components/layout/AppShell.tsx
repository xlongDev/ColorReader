                  for comes in from the other side, so the two read as one
                  surface stepping through the list. `popLayout` takes the
                  leaving page out of flow, so the arriving one is laid out at
                  its final place on the first frame rather than being pushed
                  around by a page that is already on its way out.

                  What this must not animate is anything that changes the
                  resolution of the page's raster, and both alternatives did:

                  1. It used to animate `filter: blur(6px)`, which re-rasterises
                     the whole layer every frame — the most expensive thing this
                     shell could animate, on every navigation. A `filter` — even
                     `blur(0px)` — also makes its element the containing block
                     for `position: fixed` descendants, and that resting value
                     is what put the reader's selection toolbar 273 px off and
                     sliced it at the pane edge.
                  2. It then carried the depth with `scale`, which has the same
                     cost for the same reason: a scaled subtree is rasterised at
                     the new resolution each frame. A reader page (composited
                     section iframes) and a shelf (a few hundred covers) are the
                     worst cases for it, and the reader -> shelf direction pays
                     it twice, on both pages at once.

                  A translate moves an already-rasterised layer. At rest motion
                  normalises the offset away, so the wrapper is neither a filter
                  nor a transform and fixed overlays inside a page keep the
                  viewport as their containing block. */}

          The pane above carries one for the glass, and it also has
          `overflow: hidden` — so an overlay rendered inside it was positioned
          from the pane's own origin and then sliced by the pane's edge. The
          selection toolbar landed 273px right and 37px low, and lost its right
          end to the page edge.

          This host sits inside the shell, so the reading surface's tokens and
