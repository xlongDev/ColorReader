   *    flight, each one re-rasterizing the cover at a new size. That is why a
   *    large EPUB cover stuttered where the small PNG pdf.js renders for a PDF
   *    did not.
   * 2. **The compositor owns it.** A JS-driven animation needs the main thread
   *    every frame, and the main thread is exactly what the reader is using to
   *    build its chapter at that moment — so the cover froze precisely when the
   *    reader was heaviest. A CSS transition keeps the flight running on the
