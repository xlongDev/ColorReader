   * Centre on the content pane, not on the window.
   *
   * The sidebar pushes the pane right of the window's centre — measured on a
   * 1280px window: pane centre 770 against the window's 640, so a
   * window-centred dialog sat 130px left of the thing it was covering and read
   * as off-centre to anyone looking at the shelf. The batch-manage bar was
   * re-anchored for the same reason; this is that fix generalised, so every
   * dialog agrees with the bar instead of only the import one.
   *
   * Only the horizontal is written. Vertical centring is already the pane's,
   * because the pane is the full height of the window.
   *
   * **A custom property on the root rather than an inline style on the
   * element.** The obvious version held a `ref` to the dialog and wrote
   * `style.left` — but `Dialog.Content asChild` composes the child's ref, and
   * with React 19's `ref`-as-a-prop that composition comes back null: the
   * effect ran, the pane was found, and the element was `null`, so nothing was
   * ever written. A property on `documentElement` needs no ref at all.
   *
   * **The property is deliberately not cleared on close.** This cleanup runs
   * when `open` flips false, which is when the exit animation *starts* — and
   * `left` falling back to `50%` mid-exit would slide the dialog across the
   * window as it faded. It is cleared only when a dialog finds no pane, which
   * is what makes it self-correcting rather than sticky.
   *
   * The listener is for a window resize, a real gesture while a dialog is open.
   * The sidebar needs no watching: the scrim is modal, so it cannot be toggled
   * out from under an open dialog.
