 * otherwise ellipsised and invisible, and a tooltip is too far from the eye
 * to bother with. A name that fits on one line stays a plain ellipsis — the
 * measured overflow is zero and nothing ever moves.
 *
 * **The measuring refs live in the always-rendered branch on purpose.** The
 * first version returned a bare `<span className="truncate">` when the
 * overflow was zero and only attached `outerRef`/`innerRef` on the scrolling
 * branch — but `overflow` starts at zero, so the refs were never attached, so
 * the measurement that would have raised it above zero could never run. The
 * marquee was dead code: every long name silently stayed truncated. One
 * render path now, with the classes carrying the difference.
 *
 * `prefers-reduced-motion` disables the scroll outright, so a reader who asked
 * for less motion never sees it.
