// the bundle, and it is also why the font the reader picks is held back rather
// than swapped in — see `useAdoptedFontKey`.

 * The floating read-aloud bar is this same bundle in a second window, told
 * apart by one query parameter (`commands::mini_bar::build_bar` sets it).
 *
 * It mounts its own root rather than a route because the shell is a memory
 * router: there is no URL a second window could be pointed at. It also has to
 * be its own root for a reason that matters more — the providers, and with them
 * the engine, hang off `AppRouter`, and a second engine would mean a second
 * voice.
 *
 * The cost is the whole app being parsed in that window. It is paid once, on
 * the first minimize of a session, and splitting it would mean a `lazy()` entry
 * for the app it belongs to — which is a bigger change to what the first paint
 * downloads than a small window is worth.
