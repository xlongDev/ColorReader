/**
 * Read-aloud: the queue, the wash, and the transport over it.
 *
 * This is the whole of the reader's read-aloud layer except the two things
 * that belong to the reader itself — where the voice starts when the reader
 * taps the button (it is the page's geometry), and what "the chapter ended"
 * means (it is the page's navigation). Both come in as arguments.
 *
 * It does not own the engine binding either, and that is not an oversight:
 * `goTo` stops the voice on every chapter change, so the reader needs `stop`
 * before this layer can be built, while this layer needs the reader's
 * chapter-roll callback, which is built on top of `goTo`. Handing the binding
 * in is what breaks that cycle — the alternative was a callback hidden in a
 * ref, which is one more piece of invisible state in the exact place two
 * stale-closure bugs have already come from.
 *
 * What is left here is the part that has to move together: the queue and the
 * unit the voice is on decide the wash, the wash decides where the page
 * scrolls, and every transport action restarts the queue from the position the
 * voice holds. Split any of those off and the rest has to reach back for it.
