      //   coerce stored `peel` → `peel-br` (the bottom-right grab).
      // v6: the left-right slide and both corner peels were dropped from the
      //   picker — the reader kept none / pan / fade / paper. Every one of
      //   those values falls back to `pan`, which is the same native pan path
      //   `slide` used, so a stored preference degrades to what it looked
      //   like rather than to nothing. v4's `pan → slide` coercion is gone
      //   with it: `pan` is a real option again.
      // v7: the page indicator's boolean became a three-way scope (off /
      //   current chapter / whole book). A stored `true` becomes "chapter" —
      //   the display it already had — and anything unrecognised becomes
      //   "off" rather than leaving the row with no chip selected.
      // v8: the page palette is snapshotted from the app theme on first run
      //   now, so "never chose" and "chose follow" have to be told apart. A
      //   stored `follow` is the old default and means the former — drop it to
      //   `null` so the snapshot happens on this launch. A stored `day` or
      //   `night` is a real choice and stays: pinning a page for someone who
      //   pinned it themselves is not a migration, it is a regression.
      // v9: auto-scroll speeds were halved (see `MAX_AUTO_SCROLL_SPEED`). A
      //   stored px/s is halved with them, so a reader who chose 适中 keeps
      //   the speed they chose — only the number behind it changes.
      // v12: the default layout became 单页 and `pdfNight` became a three-way
      //   axis with `follow` at its head. Both live in the migrate body rather
      //   than only in the defaults — an installed store keeps the old values,
      //   and a default nobody reads is not a change.
      // v13: the page palette is no longer snapshotted on first run — 跟随主题
      //   is the default again, and the pin the snapshot left in the top-level
      //   slot is dropped back to `null`.
