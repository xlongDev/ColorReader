/**
 * The read-aloud player, as a panel.
 *
 * One object with two homes, like the capsule beside it: inside the app it
 * opens over the reading surface that asked for it, and on the desktop it is
 * the face of the floating bar itself — which is why a reader can open the
 * player without bringing the whole app back. Nothing here reaches for a store,
 * an engine or a query: every fact arrives as a prop and every gesture leaves
 * as a callback, so the same card can be driven by a mounted reader on one
 * screen and by an event payload on the other.
 *
 * That is also why the catalogue comes in whole and the *derivations* stay
 * here: `defaultVoice`, `bookLangVoices` and `voiceGroups` are pure functions
 * over the list, so the two hosts agree on which voice is the current one by
 * construction rather than by both computing it.
 *
 * One thing travels the other way: which view is up. The bar is a *window*, and
 * a window has to be the size of what is being drawn in it — the drill-downs are
 * a third the height of the main view — so the card announces its view and the
 * host that owns a frame acts on it.
 *
 * The drill-downs move once each, and by one rule: **the row arrives, and it
 * brings its chips.** 语速, 定时关闭 and the voice picker each put a block of
 * their own where the tiles were, and that block is the whole animation — it
 * rises into the place they left and its contents are simply there. An earlier
 * cut staggered the chips in one at a time; a picker of seven rates then read as
 * seven separate events rather than as one list, and a list is a thing, so it
 * arrives once. `useMotion`'s vocabulary decides how much of that survives
 * `prefers-reduced-motion`, which is why the numbers come from there rather than
 * from this file.

 *  on a box that is changing height is a scale: measured at 2.9× through the
 *  moment 语速 opens, which is long enough to watch the play button turn into
 *  an ellipse. The size is the host's to make — the app hugs its content, the

          row to row as the voice moves.

          The area clips, on purpose. `popLayout` pins the outgoing pane at the
          box it had, and by then the card has stepped into a shorter one: left
          unclipped, the sentence list a reader was on lands on top of the
          transport. Clipped, a view change reads as the panel closing on the
          view being left while the next one is already arriving.

          No height animation on any of this — see the note on `VIEW_FADE`.

          And it only *grows* while it has something to grow for. In the
          floating bar the card is a fixed height, so a `flex-1` pane with
          nothing in it is not air at the top of the panel, it is half the
          panel: the voice picker brings a scroller of its own, and the two
          would split what the card has left between them — which is the blank
          above the transport that the picker used to open with. The other
          drill-downs are rows that hug the transport, and what is left over
