 * `data-tauri-drag-region` on the title and the clock, and dragging it by the
 * glass around them — most of it — did nothing, because the attribute is
 * checked on the node it sits on and can only ever cover the boxes it is
 * written into. This covers everything the pointer can reach, and skipping the
 * controls is what keeps their clicks.
 *
 * The press is not handed over at once, and that is what lets one box be both
 * the handle and a button. `startDragging` takes the whole mouse-down for
 * itself — a press that becomes a drag never produces a click, so a control
 * under the pointer would go dead — and here the press is watched instead: only
 * a pointer that has actually travelled 4px hands the window over, and one that
 * stays put releases into an ordinary click on whatever it landed on.
 *
 * Nothing is lost by waiting. The frame is placed from the cursor's position at
 * the moment the drag starts, and tao synthesises the left-mouse-down the
 * system asks for out of the event already in flight (`tao::drag_window`), so a
 * drag that begins on the third pixel of movement moves exactly as far as one
 * that began on the first.
