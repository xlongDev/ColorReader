/**
 * The read-aloud engine, hosted by the shell rather than by the reader.
 *
 * `useTts` used to be called from `ReaderPage`, which meant the voice was tied
 * to that page's lifetime: leaving the reader cancelled it mid-sentence. Here it
 * is mounted once, above the routes, so a session outlives the page it started
 * on — that is the whole of "background playback".
 *
 * The sleep timer comes along for the same reason: it stops the voice, so it
 * belongs with whatever holds the voice. The reader still asks it whether a
 * chapter-scoped timer has fired (that is navigation's question), and the player
 * still draws its countdown.
 *
 * `children` is handed straight through, so the hook's own re-renders — one per
 * sentence while the voice moves — reach the two consumers below and nothing
 * else in the tree.
