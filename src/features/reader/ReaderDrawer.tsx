 * The backdrop click and the ✕ both dismiss; motion slides the sheet in from
 * the right edge and back out on close, gated by reduced motion.
 *
 * It is bounded by the reading viewport rather than by the window — the box
 * between the header and the footer. Sized to the window it ran the full
 * height of the app and sat over both bars. Anchoring it here also means the
 * page keeps its own width: opening a panel never reflows the book.
 *
 * It is rendered *inside* that viewport, not portalled into one. A 对照阅读
 * pair has two viewports, and every portal-based answer to "which one" was a
 * bug waiting to happen: a lookup found the left book's, a host passed down
 * from the wrong pane found the other's. A drawer that is a child of its own
 * pane's viewport cannot land anywhere else — `absolute inset-0` resolves
 * against the box it was written in.
