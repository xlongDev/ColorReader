 * mounts this instead of flipping a prop on something already on screen: a
 * mount is the one moment a component may read a prop into state, and a fresh
 * mount is exactly what "start writing" means. Nothing has to be kept in sync
 * afterwards, because nothing else can change the draft.
 *
 * Committing compares against the saved note, so opening one and closing it
 * again costs no round trip, and emptying the field clears the note instead of
 * storing an empty string (the backend folds blanks to `NULL`, so "has a note"
 * stays a single test).
