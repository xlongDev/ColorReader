/**
 * Voices for read-aloud, presented the way readest presents them.
 *
 * Two engines feed the picker, and the reader is never asked to care which one
 * a voice comes from — except where it matters, which is that one of them needs
 * the network:
 *
 * * **system** — the platform's own `speechSynthesis` list. macOS alone ships
 *   forty-odd languages, so "readest 的全部语言" means *every* language the
 *   system reports, not a hand-picked shortlist. The only filtering is readest's
 *   novelty-voice blacklist: Fred, Bubbles and Zarvox are joke voices nobody
 *   wants in a reading picker.
 * * **edge** — Microsoft's read-aloud service, reached over the network. This is
 *   where Yunjian lives: no operating system ships it, and it is the reader's
 *   default.
 *
 * Flattened to `{ uri, name, lang, engine }` so a choice is a storable string
 * and the sorting/grouping rules are pure functions with a test beside them.
