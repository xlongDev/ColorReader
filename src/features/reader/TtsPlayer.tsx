 * — with the sentence list, the scrubber and the three settings. Both take no
 * modal — the page stays readable under them, which is the point of listening
 * to a book you are also looking at.
 *
 * Neither belongs to `ReaderPage` any more. The engine outlives that page (see
 * `TtsHost`), so a reader who walks off to their shelf keeps listening; what the
 * reader lends while it *is* on screen is the transport, and it gets it back the
 * moment the page mounts again. Everything else — what is being read, how far
 * in, the settings — is either published to `useSpeechSession` or reached
 * through the engine.
 *
 * This file is now the *wiring*: it owns the two events the bar speaks, the
 * session, the engine and the settings, and hands the card the plain facts it
 * draws. The card itself is shared with the bar, which has none of those.
