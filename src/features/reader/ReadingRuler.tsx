/**
 * A reading ruler: a band over a block of lines, with everything outside it
 * washed toward the paper.
 *
 * The band *is* a place in the text, not a record of where the pointer or the
 * page happened to be. It is measured onto real rendered lines (where they
 * actually fall, not where the settings' leading says they should), it is as
 * thick as the block it covers, and it steps by whole blocks — so it is never
 * half a line off, and never drifts. What makes it a ruler rather than a stripe
 * is the washing: the page outside the band is painted back over itself, leaving
 * the eye one lit strip of type.
 *
 * The band is therefore *not* a translucent colour laid over the words — that
 * would tint the very text it exists to clarify, and a tint is the one thing the
 * band must not do to the page. When the reader picks a colour it is a
 * translucent fill and nothing more; on 「仅描边」 the band is a pair of hairlines
 * in the page's own ink, which is the reading the reference ships as its default.
 *
 * Where the page shows one column the band spans the page. Where it shows a
 * spread — two flows side by side whose line grids do not agree — the band covers
 * the column being read and the *other* column is washed along with the rest,
 * because a band spanning both would cut lines in one of them whichever lines it
 * snapped to. Stepping runs down the column and then into the next one, and only
 * past the last one is the page over.
 *
 * The parent supplies the page (the viewport, the axis, how many columns, the
 * reader's leading, the paper). What the ruler looks like is the ruler's own
 * settings, so those it reads for itself — as the rest of the reader's panels do.

   * different thing. A book carries text the reader never sees — a print-only
   * running head, a helper laid off the column, a `font-size: 0` line that still
   * has leading — and it has a *box* for it all the same, as wide as the page's
   * content and as invisible as it is unpainted. `checkVisibility` cannot see
   * those (clipping and a zero font are not visibility), and no rule on the
   * fragment's own coordinates can either: such a box is inside the reading area
   * and inside the page. All of them land in one union, and the band comes out
   * as wide as the page instead of as wide as the words — measured on real books,
   * 13–29% of the window wider, in every state that re-lays the pane out.
   *
   * So the width is taken from the lines the band is *drawn on* — not from the
   * block it was handed. A block is a run of `rulerLines` lines, but the block
   * the reader lands on can be far taller than the band that covers it: a
   * chapter title centred in three-quarters of a blank page puts its only line at
   * the top and the paragraphs below in the same block, and the union of that
   * whole block is the page's own width. Measured on a real book, entering
   * fullscreen put the band on a 456px block holding a 124px title and the
   * paragraphs under it, and drew the band 576px wide — wider than anything the
   * reader could see on it. The band is a window on the lines it washes, so the
   * lines it washes are what it is as wide as.
   *
   * The path where a block is not a run of lines keeps its own extent: a
   * spread's block is one column of a two-column grid (its lines share heights,
   * so the block alone cannot say which column it is on).
   *
   * 🔴 **A vertical line is *not* such a path**, whatever it looks like. Its
   * "line" is a column, and a column is a block of text whose height is whatever
   * the paragraph happens to be: the columns of one page run to wildly different
   * lengths, and the last column of a chapter is a single short line. Reading the
   * full page height as the band's cross extent drew it 636px tall over a column
   * whose text is 126px — measured on a real book, overshooting the words below by
   * **418px**, most of the band sitting on blank paper. 「行没排满是两端对齐」这句话
