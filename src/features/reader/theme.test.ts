/**
 * The adopted-face read-back, against stylesheets shaped like the webfont
 * packages': one `@font-face` per `unicode-range` subset, at several weights,
 * authored `font-display: swap` like the real ones.
 *
 * **What these tests cannot see.** jsdom's CSSOM parses only a subset of the
 * `@font-face` descriptors — `src`, `unicode-range` and `font-display` are all
 * dropped on the way in, so `rule.cssText` comes back as little more than the
 * family and the weight. That leaves the url rewrite untestable here, and it is
 * covered the only way it can be: by installing a catalogue font in a real
 * engine and reading the family back out of `document.fonts` (`font-display`
 * and `font-catalog` specs).
 *
 * **The dropped `font-display` has a second consequence.** Because the
 * descriptor never survives into `cssText` here, `withBlockDisplay` takes its
 * insertion branch in every one of these tests. In a real engine it survives —
 * every rule of a fetched 霞鹜文楷 sheet reads back as `block`, in both engines
 * — and the replacement branch is the one that runs. The two branches agree on
 * their output, which is what the assertions below pin down; which one produced
 * it is an environment detail.
 *
 * So what is pinned down below is the *selection* — which rules are carried,
 * and for whom — which is the half jsdom can answer for.
