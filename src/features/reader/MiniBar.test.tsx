/**
 * The floating bar, driven the way the shell drives it.
 *
 * Everything this component knows arrives as an event and everything it does
 * leaves as one, so the test is the same conversation: hand it a payload, click
 * a control, and check what went back. `@/lib/ipc` is the whole boundary, and
 * it is mocked for exactly that reason — inside the real one, each helper
 * resolves to nothing at all outside the Tauri shell, which is what keeps the
 * bar out of the web build.
 *
 * The card is the interesting half of this file. It is the *app's* card in a
 * second window, so every control on it has to leave as a value the main window
 * can act on, and the two facts the bar is not allowed to work out for itself —
 * the window's frame and the catalogue's contents — have to arrive rather than
 * be reached for.
