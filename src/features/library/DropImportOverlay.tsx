/**
 * The shelf's invitation to drop files in.
 *
 * The old overlay was a dim scrim and a small pill. It said *something was
 * happening* without saying *where*: a reader hovering over the shelf had no
 * way to tell the whole window was the target, and the accepted formats were
 * nowhere on screen — the one question a first-time drag raises.
 *
 * So the whole shelf reads as the drop zone now: a dashed, accent-outlined
 * panel that scales in over a scrim, with the formats spelled out inside it.
 * The icon drifts a few pixels up and down while the drag lasts — the target
 * is *alive* and waiting, which is the whole message of this state. Under
 * reduced motion the drift is dropped and the panel simply appears.
 *
 * **Anchored to the content pane, not the window.** The drop zone *is* the
 * shelf — the browser build's own handlers sit on it, and the books land in the
 * list behind it — so dimming and centring over the sidebar as well invited a
 * drop where nothing would be imported. Rendered inside the page and
 * `absolute`, it takes the pane's `relative` box as its origin: the scrim is
 * clipped to the pane's rounded corners and the panel lands on the pane's
 * centre, with no measuring, no resize listener, and nothing to drift when the
 * sidebar is toggled. `z-50` clears the read-aloud pill's own layer (`z-40`),
 * which also lives inside the pane.
