/**
 * Reading a clippings file back into highlights.
 *
 * Two shapes are understood, and they are the two this app writes (see
 * `notes.ts`): its Markdown page and its CSV table. A Kindle's own
 * `My Clippings.txt` is **not** — that reader is six hundred lines on the
 * desktop, tested against devices neither of us can fix, and carrying it over
 * for a file the browser build has no reason to meet is not worth the code. A
 * file that is not ours is refused with a sentence rather than read badly.
 *
 * The rules below are the desktop's, so a file written by either build reads in
 * both. Where they are subtle the reason is carried over too: the link closes an
 * entry and stamps itself on the line above it; a `> ` inside a note belongs to
 * the note; a bare `>` is a blank line within a quote; a CSV column is found by
 * name, which is why a column added to the writer cannot break this reader.
