/**
 * The app's motion vocabulary.
 *
 * Before this module the UI carried seven different spring specs and as many
 * durations, which read as seven different apps stitched together. Everything
 * that moves now names one of these instead.
 *
 * Two rules the numbers encode:
 *
 * - **Spatial changes are springs.** Position, size and scale read as physical
 *   only if they behave physically, and a spring that is interrupted carries
 *   its velocity into the next one instead of restarting from rest.
 * - **Non-spatial changes are durations.** A spring on opacity or colour only
 *   adds latency; there is nothing to overshoot.
 *
 * Damping ratios sit between 0.73 and 0.85 — enough overshoot to feel alive,
 * far short of a toy. The `--ease-*` and `--blur-*` tokens in `globals.css`
 * are the same vocabulary for the CSS-driven animations (page turns, the heat
 * map), which cannot reach a spring.
