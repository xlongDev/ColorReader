/**
 * A long author name slides out from under the mask on hover.
 *
 * This is the one shelf behaviour that has no other symptom: `MarqueeText`
 * measures its own overflow and only then decides to scroll, so a component
 * that never measures looks exactly like a name that happens to fit — an
 * ellipsis, and nothing else. It shipped that way once. The first version
 * returned a bare `<span className="truncate">` while the overflow was zero
 * and attached the measuring refs only on the scrolling branch, which meant
 * the refs were never attached and the overflow could never leave zero.
 *
 * So the assertions are, in order: the fixture really is a long name in a
 * narrow slot (or the rest proves nothing), the component noticed, and the
 * name actually moves. The last one is the only one the dead version could not
 * have satisfied.
 *
 * `prefers-reduced-motion` turns the slide off by design, and Playwright's
 * default is `no-preference`, so the slide is expected here.
