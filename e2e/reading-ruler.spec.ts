/**
 * The reading ruler: a band over a block of real lines, with everything outside
 * it washed toward the paper.
 *
 * The band is a *window cut in the page*, not a strip laid over one, and it is
 * sized to the lines it covers rather than to an arithmetic offset — so the
 * assertions here are geometry, measured off the page rather than pinned:
 * WebKit lays the same Chinese text out differently from Chromium, so a
 * hardcoded band height would only be pinning the engine. What is asserted is
 * the shape of the thing:
 *
 * 1. the band and the four washes tile the reading area exactly — nothing
 *    outside the band is left at full contrast, and the band is rounded;
 * 2. its thickness follows the reader's line count;
 * 3. it lands on whole lines, and lands on whole lines again after a page turn
 *    (the foliate path is the one that has to be asked where its lines are);
 * 4. dragging it moves it, follows the hand, and the place is remembered;
 * 5. the colour and the opacity reach the pixels;
 * 6. vertical type stands the band up;
 * 7. on a spread it covers *one* column, and the other one is washed with the
 *    rest of the page;
 * 8. an arrow key steps it a whole block at a time, and the step is a move
 *    rather than a jump.
 *
 * The line boxes are read straight out of the page — for a foliate book through
 * `foliate-view`'s shadow DOM, which is where the section iframe lives. That is
 * the same reading the ruler itself makes, deliberately: what no unit test can
 * see is whether the ruler got the *sections'* geometry and not some other
 * document's, and this is what checks that it did.

  // out 66.6px over 46.6px of words, three lines under a two-line setting. That

  // onPage, the placement key, crossOf) all passed here — they are about *which*

  //

  //   first — 0.9px from the 1.8 preset — and the slot stayed green with the
  //   guard removed.
  // - Its paragraphs run to three or more lines, so a `rulerLines`-long block
  //   sits *inside* one and the padding is measurable beside it. At two lines the
  //   block was the whole paragraph, its extent already carried the 0.78em gap,
  //   and the padding was a rounding error — green again, for a different reason.
  //
  // The demo prose book was tried here too and cannot be used: it ships no
  // stylesheet, so 跟随书籍 leaves it on the browser's `normal` leading, which on
  // WebKit is an 18px advance against a 25.2px glyph box — the line boxes

  // 🔴 The assertion this test used to make, and why it was wrong: it read the

  // with a real top and a real bottom — its height is whatever the paragraph is —
  // so the columns of one page run to different lengths and a chapter's last is
  // one short line. Measured on a real book (《认识世界》, 18px 竖排) the ruler drew
  // every band the full 636px of the reading area, overhanging the words below by
  // 269–418px. The old assertion could not have caught that: it asserted the band
  // *equalled* the page, so a band running past it passed too.
  //
  // What holds: the band is as tall as the text it washes, give or take a line's
  // padding — and the padding is the *reader's own* configured leading, not the
  // page's, because that is what `pad` is in the render (`round(pitch × 0.3)` with
  // `pitch` the reader's font size times its line-height preset). In vertical the
  // page's own leading is the *step between columns*, the other axis, so it says
  // nothing about how far the band may stand off the top of a column.
  //
  // So the slack is bounded by what a padding of that size can possibly be: at
  // most three tenths of a line, and the line is at least as tall as the smallest
  // column on the page. Read that off the fixture rather than hardcoding a
  // setting — 🔴 hardcoding 18 × 1.8 failed here for a reason worth keeping: the
