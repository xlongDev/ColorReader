/**
 * The notes page's manage mode, its export and its edit affordance.
 *
 * Four things are worth pinning down here, and none of them can be seen from
 * jsdom:
 *
 * 1. The batch bar sits centred on the *page*, not on the window. The shelf
 *    learned this the hard way twice — first a `motion` transform ate an
 *    inline `-50%`, then a `-translate-x-1/2` centred the bar on the window
 *    while the sidebar pushes the pane ~130px right of that. The bar here is
 *    placed against the pane's measured box, so the assertion measures the
 *    same element the effect does.
 *
 * 2. A row in manage mode is one big target. The passage stops being a button
 *    and an overlay carries the gesture instead, with the content underneath
 *    dropping pointer events — `click()` is the assertion, because Playwright
 *    refuses to click an element that does not receive the pointer at its own
 *    centre. That is exactly the failure the shelf's scrim produced.
 *
 * 3. There is no scrim. One on the shelf covered the selection surface, so
 *    every click on a card exited the mode. Escape is the keyboard way out and
 *    it is asserted here for the same reason.
 *
 * 4. A batch delete takes exactly the rows that were picked, across books, and
 *    the tally follows. The two fixture books are demo-1 (我们为什么会生病,
 *    three highlights) and demo-2 (金色梦乡, two) — five in all.

/**
 * Boots the app, walks to the notes page, and answers with a locator scoped to
 * it.
 *
 * `goto("/notes?demo=1")` does not work and looks like it should: the router is
 * a *memory* router with `initialEntries: ["/"]`, so the app always boots on the
 * shelf whatever the path says. `?demo=1` still has to be on the document URL,
 * because that is what `demoEnabled()` reads — so the demo flag rides in on the
 * boot navigation and the route is reached by clicking, as a reader would.
 *
 * Everything afterwards is scoped to the returned locator rather than to the
 * page, because the route cross-fade keeps the *shelf* mounted while the notes
 * page arrives — and the shelf has a 批量管理 button of its own. Measured: an
 * unscoped `getByRole("button", { name: "批量管理" })` resolves to two elements
 * during the transition and Playwright refuses to guess.
