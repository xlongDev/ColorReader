/**
 * A modal centres on the content pane, not on the window.
 *
 * The sidebar pushes the pane right of the window's centre — measured on a
 * 1280px window, pane centre 770 against the window's 640 — so a
 * window-centred dialog sits 130px left of the surface it is covering and
 * reads as off-centre to anyone looking at the shelf. That is the whole of
 * "导入摘录的ui侧边栏展开的时候没有居中", and it is the second time this
 * reference was wrong: the batch-manage bar was placed against the window too,
 * and `shelf-manage.spec.ts` pins it for the same reason.
 *
 * Both assertions matter and neither is enough alone. Centring on the pane
 * passes the first; the second fails if the pane and the window happen to have
 * drifted together, which is what would happen if `data-content-pane` were
 * ever moved onto the shell instead of the reading surface.
 *
 * The import dialog is the one the reader reported, and it is a fine stand-in
 * for all of them: `GlassDialog` is a single component, so every dialog in the
 * app is anchored by the same code path.
