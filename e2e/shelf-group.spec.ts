/**
 * The shelf cut into sections.
 *
 * The headings are lines of the windowed list rather than labels floating over
 * it, which costs the window its single row pitch: two kinds of line mean two
 * heights, and every position had to be recomputed from the items. That makes
 * the interesting failures the ones a flat list would never show, so they are
 * what is pinned here:
 *
 * - the shelf is actually **reordered** into its piles, not merely labelled —
 *   two of three books change slots below;
 * - a heading *takes room*, so the two spacers plus the rendered lines still
 *   have to add up to the height the whole list would have had — the 84-book
 *   scroll test below is the only thing that would catch a heading measured
 *   differently from how it is drawn;
 * - a folded pile is out of the list, not hidden in it, so its cards stop
 *   being rendered and the shelf closes up;
 * - nothing is sectioned until a group is chosen.
