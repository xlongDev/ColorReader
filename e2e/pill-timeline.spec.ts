 * THROWAWAY diagnostic. Green when the pill is steady; red *with the whole
 * timeline attached* when it is not.
 *
 * A CI run of `tts-pill.spec.ts` failed seven times over with two different
 * words — "element is not stable" and "element was detached from the DOM" —
 * plus one "element(s) not found", and one more where the reader's own `footer`
 * could not be measured for thirty seconds. Three symptoms, one shape: things
 * being **destroyed and rebuilt**, not things being in the wrong place. This
 * watches for exactly that, and samples the two things a reader would feel if it
 * were happening to them: whether the pill is there, and whether it is where it
 * was.
 *
 * The proxy for the engine's state is the transport button's own wording — 暂停
 * while a voice is on, 播放 when there is none — so nothing here reaches into the
 * app.
