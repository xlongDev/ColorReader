 * The read-aloud pill, and the one thing it exists for: a session outliving the
 * page it was started on.
 *
 * Read-aloud used to be the reader's own — engine, queue and player all mounted
 * by `ReaderPage` — so walking off to the shelf cancelled the voice in that
 * page's teardown. The engine is hosted by the shell now (`TtsHost`), the pill
 * rides with it, and the reader only *lends* it a transport while it is on
 * screen. What the reader gives up in exchange is its footer: the pill is
 * anchored to the content pane, so the pane's bottom edge is a shared edge and
 * the pill has to be lifted clear of the footer rather than land on it.
 *
 * What is asserted is the teardown, not the voice, because a headless browser
 * has no voice to hear: `speechSynthesis.cancel()` being called across a
 * navigation *is* the bug, whichever engine would have answered. The suite runs
 * in both engines (see `playwright.config.ts`) and the count is the one fact
 * they agree on — Chromium's headless voice really speaks and WebKit's does
 * not, and neither of those is what this is about.
