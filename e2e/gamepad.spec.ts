 * scrolled-layout tests all ran on `/?demo=1`, and that sample is a **plain-text**
 * book, whose `[data-reading-content]` really is `overflow-y-auto`. A book
 * foliate renders is `overflow-hidden` — foliate owns the scrollport inside the
 * section — so the same code wrote its scroll to a box that cannot scroll. Every
 * symptom followed from that one fact: the page never followed the band, and the
 * chapter switched when the band reached the bottom of the *window* rather than
 * of the chapter (「页面才滚动到显示页面的底部就切换到下一章」).
 *
 * So: a real EPUB, and the assertion is the contract the scroll layout now has.
 * The band's own steps walk it down the window; past the trigger line the step
 * stops moving the band and moves the **page** instead — the text glides one
 * measured block under a band that holds its place. Either way the chapter must
 * not change while the chapter still has text left: a switch here means the flow
