/**
 * Batch-manage mode.
 *
 * Three things are worth pinning down here:
 *
 * 1. The action bar sits centred on the shelf, not 150px off to the right of
 *    centre. A previous `motion.div` used `x: "-50%"` inside its own animate
 *    values; motion's transform overrode the inline `-50%` as soon as the
 *    spring settled, which left the bar visually off-centre. That fix used
 *    Tailwind v4's `-translate-x-1/2` (the `translate` property, not
 *    `transform`), which motion does not touch — but it centred the bar on
 *    the *window*, and the shelf is not the window: the sidebar pushes the
 *    reading pane ~130px right of centre, so the bar still read as off-centre
 *    to anyone looking at the shelf. It is now placed against the pane's
 *    measured centre.
 *
 *    Note what this test used to measure: the bar was reached through
 *    `getByRole("button", { name: "退出批量管理" })`, which was the *scrim* —
 *    a `fixed inset-0` button whose centre is the window's by construction.
 *    The assertion held regardless of where the bar sat.
 *
 * 2. A card click selects, and does not open the book. This is the whole
 *    mode, and it was broken: the scrim covered the shelf, so every click on
 *    a book landed on the dismiss layer and exited the mode instead. Both
 *    engines showed the same topmost element at a card's centre — the scrim,
 *    not the card. Playwright's own actionability check is the assertion:
 *    `click()` fails outright if the target does not receive the pointer.
 *
 * 3. Escape leaves the mode and drops the selection. With the scrim gone the
 *    keyboard needed its own way out; the bar's 完成 is the pointer one.
